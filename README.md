# LED Control software

This project's code is intended to drive the function of RGB strips via buttons. I didn't like the idea of having a remote control tied to my vehicle, and physical switches are more robust. Additionally, I only want a select few colors of light - namely amber, white, and red. In this case, driving 12V 5050-SMD LEDs from a 5v Pro Micro clone using MOSFETS.
